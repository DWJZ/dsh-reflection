/**
 * The harness surface this plugin uses, declared here rather than imported.
 *
 * The harness publishes types with its packages, but the versions on npm lag the
 * harness this plugin runs against (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent` publishes 0.1.0-rc.6
 * while the running harness is 0.2.0-rc.2), and this plugin is not a pnpm
 * workspace member, so it cannot resolve them from a checkout either. Typing
 * against a stale package would describe an API the plugin does not run on,
 * which is worse than no types at all.
 *
 * So only the members this plugin actually calls are declared, with the shapes it
 * relies on. They are hand-written: when the harness changes one of these
 * members, nothing fails here until `npm run typecheck` is read. `@deepseek-ai/cordis`
 * itself is a real devDependency at the version this checkout vendors, so the
 * plugin shape, `Context` identity and event plumbing come from the official
 * package; this file only adds what the harness layers on top.
