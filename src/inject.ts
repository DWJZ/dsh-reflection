/**
 * Context injection, and what the plugin knows about the current turn.
 *
 * A request carries a bounded summary of Memory and the paths of the files that
 * hold the facts; the facts themselves are read on demand, either straight from
 * those files or through `memory_search` / `memory_get`. The summary travels as
 * runtime context, which the agent loop logs as model history, so a replayed
 * session reconstructs the same text.
 *
 * Reading the session log synchronously is deprecated, so the plugin learns the
 * current turn's input by observing `session/event`: the last human `user/message`
 * is captured when a turn starts, which binds provenance to the input that began
 * the turn rather than to whichever message happens to be last.
