/**
 * dsh-reflection — host half.
 *
 * Persistent user and project Memory for DeepSeek Harness. Every record lives
 * under `$DSH_HOME/memory`, never inside a project, and a compact index of the
 * active records is injected into each new Session.
 *
 * Memory is reached two ways. The explicit path is the `memory_*` tools and the
 * `/memory` command: the user asks, and the record is written immediately.
 * The automatic path is consolidation, which reads a finished turn after the
 * agent goes idle, asks a model what in it is worth keeping, and commits only
 * what a deterministic review accepts. Both paths write through the same Phase 1
 * actions, so scope, provenance and screening behave identically.
 *
 * The index and the model tools are registrations, so disabling Memory disposes
 * them rather than leaving callbacks that quietly do nothing. The `/memory`
 * command stays registered in both states, because it is the only way back.
 *
 * The one harness package this plugin imports at runtime is
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session`, for `appendPluginRecord`: the record envelope — the
 * `plugin:` name grammar, the `ignorable` marker, the JSON snapshot — is the
 * harness's to write, and a plugin cannot set that marker through
 * `Session.append()` itself.
 *
