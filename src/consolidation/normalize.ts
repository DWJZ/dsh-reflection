/**
 * Turn raw Session events into the trajectory a consolidation model may read.

 * Three questions are answered here, and only here:
 * - which events may reach the model,
 * - which may not, but are still consumed,
 * - which are so unexpected that the batch must refuse to run at all.
 *
 * The last category is the one that matters most. The harness marks an event a
 * reader may safely skip with `ignorable: true`; an event without that marker is
 * one a reader is expected to understand, and the session log itself is refused
 * on an unknown type for the same reason. Silently dropping an event this build
 * does not recognize would hide a change in what a turn contains, so the batch
 * fails and names the type instead.
 *
 * Usage: `import { classify, batchWindow } from './normalize.js'`.
