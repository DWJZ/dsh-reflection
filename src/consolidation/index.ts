/**
 * One consolidation run, from the progress mark to the next one.
 *
 * The order below is the whole design, and each step exists because skipping it
 * loses something:
 *
 * 1. Reconcile the mark with what this process actually observed. Events from
 *    before the plugin mounted, or from a Session resumed elsewhere, are not in
 *    the buffer and cannot be read back; the range is recorded as a gap so "not
 *    observed" never reads as "read and held nothing".
 * 2. Take the bounded window. Ignorable and internal events are counted and
 *    consumed; an unknown event stops the run and names itself.
 * 3. Require a human turn. An idle period with no human input is not a reason to
 *    ask a model anything, and the window is consumed so it is not re-examined.
 * 4. Ask once, review the answer, commit through Phase 1, then move the mark.
 *
 * A failure anywhere before the commit leaves the mark alone, so the next
 * eligible idle period retries the same window. A partial commit does too, and
 * the retry re-reads Memory and decides again rather than replaying a plan that
 * was formed against state that has since moved.
 *
 * Usage: `const outcome = await consolidation.consolidate(agent)`.
