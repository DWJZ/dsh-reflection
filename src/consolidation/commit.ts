/**
 * Commit a reviewed plan through the Phase 1 actions.
 *
 * There is no second storage path. Every operation becomes the same
 * `addMemory` / `updateMemory` / `supersedeMemory` call an explicit request
 * makes, so it takes the same lock, passes the same secret screening, is checked
 * against the same canonical schema, and rebuilds the same derived view.
 *
 * Three outcomes are distinguished, because the caller's next move depends on
 * which one happened:
 *
 * - `committed` — Memory changed.
 * - `skipped` — the action declined to write: a duplicate, or a target that
 *   moved between review and commit. Memory is unchanged and nothing is wrong;
 *   re-running would reach the same conclusion, so this must not hold the
 *   progress mark back.
 * - `failed` — the write itself did not happen. This is what keeps the mark in
 *   place so the window is retried.
 *
 * Usage: `const outcome = await commitOperations(options, accepted)`.
