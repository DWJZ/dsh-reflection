/**
 * Scripted model adapter for the cross-session integration suite.
 *
 * It decides from the request it is given rather than from a recorded fixture:
 * a turn whose user text asks to remember something produces a Memory write, and
 * every other turn produces a plain answer. Each request is recorded verbatim so
 * the suite can assert on what the model was actually sent.
 *
 * Two guards keep it honest and bounded: a turn that already carries this
 * adapter's own call is answered with text, so a rejected call is never issued
 * again forever, and the session-title agent — which also sees the user's words —
 * is answered without tools.
 *
 * Test-only: nothing ships this file.
